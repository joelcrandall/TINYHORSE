Class assignment homework

I've finished the header and footer and marked the sections in contact.html. You can copy and paste them into your own pages from there. The links don't have filled in href attributes because I don't remember which pages everyone else was doing so make sure to fill those out with your page. Also remove the class active from the contact link and put it on the link to your page. You will also need to link the header.css stylesheet in the head of your page. ---- Austin
